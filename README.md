Conditioned FNO is proposed based on the Fourier neural operator. It accepts both field input (as generally discuss in related paper) and vector type input. 
The operator then models an operator which is continous in the functional space with respect to vector type parameters. The architecture is inspired by the time embedding in UNet.
A featuring application of CFNO is the data driven approach in solving Bayesian inverse problems. The goal of such problems is to generate posterior distribution of a field $u$ given (partial) observation of $\mathcal{G}(u)$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a nonlinear operator.
Our approach in the example models the posterior distribution by a Diffusion model (more precisely CEM). The backward process starts with white noise and solves a backward SDE where the conditional score functional is approximated by CFNO.
